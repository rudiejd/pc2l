/**
 * A class that encapsulates information being exchange between the
 * distributed processes in the system. The messages are
 * flat/contiguous pieces of information, but with varying sized
 * payloads.  Sending/receiving messages can take some CPU time,
 * particularly due to memory-allocation, and memory-copying
 * overheads.  Hence, this class has been designed to minimize the
 * overheads in the following ways: <ol>
 *
 * <li>Each message is created (see the overloaded create messages)
 * with a single allocation, to contain both the message-header (fixed
 * size) and varying-size payload.  That way a second allocation for
 * the payload is not needed.  Moreover, it ensures that all the
 * information associated with a message is contiguous in memory.</li>
 *
 * <li>Having the message-header and the payload in a contiguous block
 * enables messages to be sent and received in a single operation.</li>
 *
 * <li>A Message can also be created from a fixed backing buffer to
 * further streamline receiving and processing messages.</li>
 *
 *  </ol>
 *
 * The above features come with the following caveats when working
 * with a Message:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li>Due to their non-standard memory model, messages are not
 * movable or copyable using the traditional copy-constructor or
 * move-constructor.</li>
 *
 * <li>Enabling buffer reuse requires a non-standard approach for
 * memory deallocation.  Hence, it is important that a message pointer
 * is never deleted.  Instead, let the MessagePtr (a std::shared_ptr)
 * automatically handle deletion of messages. </li>
 *
 * </ol>
