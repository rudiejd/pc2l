    \brief Class and macros for generating a pc2l::Exception

    This file provides the definition for a custom exception class
    that is used by the various methods and classes in a general
    purpose way to throw suitable exceptions when error conditions
    occur.  The pc2l::Exception has been designed to include suitable
    information about an exception along with suggestion.  However,
    some of the information may not be useful/suitable for reporting
    exceptions to end users or should not be placed in release
    versions.  Consequently, such information can be effectively
    compiled out.  To ease uniform generation of exceptions this file
    also defines an PC2L_EXP macro that must be used for throwing an
    exception.  The working of the macros are controlled by compiler
    flags which automatically include or exclude additional debugging
    information.  Refer to the documentation on the macros and the
    class for further details.

/** A general purpose Exception class that may be readily reused.

    This class defines a generic exception that may be thrown by
    different classes and methods in PC2L.  The \c pc2l::Exception
    class has been defined to encapsulate additional information
    regarding an exception thrown.  The objective is to provide a
    reasonably-detailed error message to aid in troubleshooting and
    debugging the source code.  The class provides various member
    functions that can be used to access the various pieces of
    information stored in the exception class, such as:

    <UL> <li> The error code associated with the exception (must be
	non-zero). </li>
        
	<li> The error string for the exception (maybe empty). </li>

	<li> Any suggestions to recover from the error (maybe empty). </li>

	<li> Source file name (empty is not available). </li>

	<li> Line number in source file (zero if not available). </li>
    </UL>

    <p>The exceptions thrown by all methods constituting the
    implementation of a class may extend this class for further
    customization.  Note that the \c pc2l::Exception class is fully
    self sufficient and can be directly used for generating
    exceptions.  However, if need for further customization is
    desired, then a new exception sub-class can be created.</p>

    <p>Depending on the type of environment being developed (\em i.e.,
    for release or internal debugging) the pc2l::Exception can include
    additional information (such as source code file name and line
    number) to aid in debugging.  To ease generation of such
    exceptions, a EXP macro has been defined, that suitably creates a
    new \c pc2l::Exception class using suitable parameters.</p>

    \note When throwing a \c pcl2::Exception always use the \c PC2L_EXP
    macro defined in this header file.  Here is a short example of how
    to use the \c PC2L_EXP macro:
    
    \code
    throw PC2L_EXP("Invalid file: %s", "Check command-line arguments", path);
    \endcode

public:
    /** The default and only constructor.

        <p>The \c pc2l::Exception class has been defined to
        encapsulate as much information as possible regarding an
        exception thrown.  The objective is to provide a detailed
        error message to aid in troubleshooting and debugging the
        source code.</p>

        <p>All the information regarding an exception must be provided
        as a part of the constructor.  The primary objective is to
        eliminate any unwanted side effects that may arise when
        creating the exception (and the members of the exception are
        all constant objects) and to avoid uncontrolled changes to an
        exception once it has been created.</p>

        printf style format string to ease printing variables/values
        in exception error messages. Ideally, this should use a
        std::format like approach, but we are using a more traditional
        printf style appraoch for backwards compatibility.

        \param suggestion A text message suggesting how to avoid this
        exception. This can also be a format string. Note that the
        same variadic arguments are passed to both errorMessage and
        suggestion.
